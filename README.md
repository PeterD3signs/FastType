# FastType
A tool to check and improve your typing speed.

This project was created in 2023 and contains all files in the exact form they were coded during that time.
It also won't be changed in the future. I decided to keep this repo original to better show my code progression.

The project was done as part of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Java Course during my University studies. I received the highest mark possible for this project.

DESCRIPTION:
This tool is a single-window Java FX application written without using any window builders.
It is inspired by Monkeytype.com and allows you to practice quick typing in many languages.
The main goal for this app was to create a friendly UI and to practice custom animations. 

After completing each session the user can see their statistics (missed / wrong / additional characters, wpm for each word, average wpm in time and many more...).
Apart from that, the result is written to a file that is created automatically in the /results folder.

What would I change if I were to make this project again:
- I would improve the layout of the files.
